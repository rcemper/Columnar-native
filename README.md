# Columnar test IRIS native
The package creates a very basic IRIS instance in Docker    
the code is also available in IPM
## Description
+ The idea of this package is to compare performance of columnar storage   
**inside** IRIS without wrapping it to some foreign platform that is not my world 
* In addition I do not want to measure network performance between 2 containers,    
but inside a closed IRIS environment that I have fully under my control 
* Even the use of SMP or some other browser-based presentation has some     
influence that I want to avoid. Measuring should be as close to the core as possible.  
So I flagged it NATIVE. Some people might feel it is ABORIGINAL. 
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.
### Installation
Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rcemper/Columnar-native.git
```
To build and start the container run:
```
$ docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f
```
To open IRIS Terminal do:
```
$ docker-compose exec iris iris session iris
USER>
```
or using **iTerm**
```
http://localhost:42773/iterm/
```
To access IRIS System Management Portal
```
http://localhost:42773/csp/sys/UtilHome.csp
```
### How to use it
All tests are running in Namespace USER and are initiated    
exclusively from the command prompt. 
```
USER>do ^Demo
Test Columnar vs. Row Storage
=============================
     1 - Initialize Tables
     2 - Generate Data
     3 - Compare SELECT
     4 - Loop SELECT
     5 - Auto Loop
Select Function or * to exit :
```
* 1 create/clear the tables. Package name **A** to be on top in search
* 2 fills it with EXACTLY the same data (INSERT --- SELECT)
* 3 runs **SELECT AVG(Amount) FROM A.??? WHERE Status = 'SENT'**
* 4 allows to add data between SELECT cycles
* 5 does the same in a larger loop
  
Being curious I added also DemoB where row store is more advanced   
using Bitmap Index and Bitslice Index. This was not so impressive.
### Summary
The gain in speed is significant and data generated by option 5    
provided the base of this EXCEL diagram. No surprises!
